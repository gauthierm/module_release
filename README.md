</pre>

Release Metadata File
---------------------
The **prepare-site** and **release-site** tools can use a file named
`release-metadata.ini` if it exists. The format of the file is as follows:

```ini
[site]
title = "My Human-Readable Title"  ; Human-readable site title for messages

[testing]
url = "https://$hostname/testpath" ; URL to visit to perform manual testing
command = "composer run test"      ; command to run automated tests
```

### Variable Interpolation

The metadata file may use the following variables inside values:

 - **$hostname** - the hostname of the machine where the release is being prepared.
 - **$branch** - the name of the current Git branch.

Other variables will be ignored and used verbatim.

### Lerna Monorepos

For sites using a lerna monorepo setup, the `scope.is_web` setting is used to control
which packages are built for a web deployment. Packages are built in the order they appear
in the metadata file, for example:

```
[shared]
scope.is_web = true

[web]
scope.is_web = true

```

Development
-----------
These tools uses [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). To test during
development, make sure you have the required packages installed by running
`composer install`.

You can run to tool using `./bin/package-release`.

Deployment
----------
To update tools used in staging after changes have been merged you first
must release the package using `package-release` for a working dir in 
`/so/packages/package-release` -- then ansible should be run against
staging servers using the composer_global tag. E.x.
`ansible-playbook -l dev site.yml --tags composer_global`
